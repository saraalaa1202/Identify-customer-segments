# Identify-customer-segments

<h5>This project about identify customer segments, I used K-means unsupervised learning algorithm and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to dimensionality reduction</h5>

In this project we have two dataset the first one is general dataset for people of Germany and the second for customers of a mail-order sales company.

Steps of the project as follows:
<ol>
   <li>Load The data</li>
   <li>Preprocessing (Data Cleaning & engineering)</li>
   <li>Feature Transformation (feature scaling and perform the PCA)</li>
   <li>Interpret Principal Components</li>
  <li>Clustering</li>
  <li>Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data</li>
</ol>

Notice: the two datasets are not included in this repository.
